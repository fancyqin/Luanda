MARCUS JORDAN (Michael Jordan's son): I remember all of it. It as a fun weekend, spent with family. I think it was one of my dad's most special weekends, and greatest achievements. … Growing up, I definitely saw him emotional. But I don’t think it was the same emotions he had that day.

STEPHAN SAVOIA (Associated Press photographer): So he comes up, he's introduced. He walks up to the podium, and drops his head, and starts crying. Before he said a word. … As soon as he walked up and his head was down, we knew there was an emotion there that was probably honest in its origin. And it became apparent, once he started talking, that he was truly humbled.

MARCUS JORDAN: The realization that his playing days were over, and just the culmination of his career, led to him being overfilled with joy.

STEPHAN SAVOIA (AP): The Hall of Fame, I've probably covered it at least half the years I've been working here. I did Charles Barkley, I did a number of the big guys. And there's never any emotion like that. … He was overcome by tears. He couldn't speak.

It's not a heavily attended event for press photographers. There’s basically only five or six of us. They all, in that first minute or so, decided, he's crying – [after snapping pictures] the Reuters guy pulls his disc, he's about to file. Once one guy pulls his disc, when you’re in a group like that, everybody starts pulling their disc.

But Jordan wasn't done crying. So I just hung in there. And about 10 seconds after they all get their discs in their computers, and they're in the middle of scanning, Jordan raises his head.
